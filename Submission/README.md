Alison McCondichie - Homework 19 - Unsupervised Learning

This project utilizes Python and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency markets and their fluctuations across various time periods. 
Initially, the data frame was scaled to enhance efficiency. I then employed the K-means clustering algorithm to segment the data. Following the evaluation of these clusters, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to further refine the dataset. The results indicated that the PCA model provided a higher level of accuracy. 
You can find a detailed explanation of the methodology and findings in the markdown sections of the Jupyter notebook.
